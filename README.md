# ManageIQ cross-repository testing framework

```
Usage: manageiq-cross_repo --test-repo repo [--repos repo1 repo2 ...]

manageiq-cross_repo is a cross repository test framework for the ManageIQ project.
Its purpose is to allow running multiple repository tests suites in the context
of other repositories and is particularly useful when trying to determine if the
changes you are making as a developer will affect the other test suites.

Options:
  -t, --test-repo=<s>     This is the repository which will be tested.
                          Can also be passed as a TEST_REPO environment variable.
                           (default: ManageIQ/manageiq@master)
  -r, --repos=<s+>        Optional, a list of other repos and/or gems to override while running the tests.
                          If any of the repositories in the list are a core repository that will
                          be used as the root repository, otherwise ManageIQ/manageiq@master will be the default.
                          Can also be passed as a REPOS environment variable.

  -v, --version           Print version and exit
  -h, --help              Show this message
