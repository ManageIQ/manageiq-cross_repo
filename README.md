# ManageIQ cross-repository testing framework

```
Usage: manageiq-cross_repo --test-repo repo [--core-repo repo] [--gem-repos repo1 repo2 ...]

manageiq-cross_repo is a cross repository test framework for the ManageIQ project.
Its purpose is to allow running multiple repository tests suites in the context
of other repositories and is particularly useful when trying to determine if the
changes you are making as a developer will affect the other test suites.

Options:
  -t, --test-repo=<s>     This is the repository which will be tested.
                          Can also be passed as a TEST_REPO environment variable.
                           (default: ManageIQ/manageiq@master)
  -c, --core-repo=<s>     Used to specify a different core branch in which plugin tests will run.
                           If --test-repo is a plugin, defaults to ManageIQ/manageiq@master.
                           If --test-repo is a core repo, this option is not allowed.
                          Can also be passed as a CORE_REPO environment variable.
  -g, --gem-repos=<s+>    Optional, a list of other plugin/gem overrides which are needed to run the tests.
                          Can also be passed as a GEM_REPOS environment variable.

  -v, --version           Print version and exit
  -h, --help              Show this message

Repo Formats:
  Remote: [org/]repository[@ref|#pr]
    org:        Optional, defaults to ManageIQ.
    repository: Required, the name of the repository.
    @ref:       Optional, defaults to master if #pr not set. Can be a branch, tag, or SHA. Mutually exclusive with #pr.
    #pr:        Optional, references a pull-request number. Mutually exclusive with @ref.

  URL: https://github.com/org/repository, https://github.com/org/repository/tree/branch,
       https://github.com/org/repository/commit/sha, https://github.com/org/repository/pull/pr

  Local: Either a fully qualified path or a relative path (e.g. /path/to/repo, ~/relative/to/home, ../relative/to/current/dir)
